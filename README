== Requirements
ruby 1.9.1 - assumes that the ruby binary is called ruby19
eventmachine gem

== Booting
The talker consists of two processes. The connection server accepts connections and acts as a proxy between the user and the main talker process. It will attempt to boot the main talker process if it
can not make a connection. If the talker process crashes the connections will be maintained and the
talker will be reloaded.

To start the connection server type:
ruby19 connection_server.rb

The main talker process will be automatically started if it isn't already running. Killing the 
connection server will not stop the talker process. Use the 'shutdown' command inside the talker or
if this is not possible then kill the process from the terminal.
